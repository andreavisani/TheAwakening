# The Awakening: A Unity 2D Horror Experience

Welcome to The Awakening! This Unity 2D horror experience's scripts were developed during the Christmas break between my first and second semesters as a Computer Programming student. At that time, I was in the early stages of my computer studies, so while creating this project, I had to face various difficulties along the way. Despite the challenges, this project marks a significant learning experience and serves as a stepping stone into the world of software development.
